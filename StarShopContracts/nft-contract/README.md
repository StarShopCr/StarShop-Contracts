## ⚙️ Setup & Deployment

### 📦 Prerequisites

- Rust and Cargo installed.
- Stellar CLI installed (`cargo install stellar-cli`).
- Stellar testnet account with funds.

### 🖥️ Environment Setup

Follow the environment setup instructions from the [Stellar Official Guide](https://soroban.stellar.org/), including Rust toolchain installation, editor configuration, and CLI setup.

### 🔗 Compilation

To compile the contract, follow these steps:

```sh
stellar contract build
```

### For optimized builds:

```sh
stellar contract optimize --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/implement-nft-contract.wasm
```

### 🚀 Deployment  
Refer to the official Stellar CLI documentation for detailed deployment instructions. Ensure that:  

- The contract is properly compiled.  
- A valid testnet account is configured.  
- The contract is deployed and registered using:  

```sh
stellar contract deploy
```

### 🧪 Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite to verify security and functionality:

```sh
cargo test
```

**All 24 tests should pass with zero warnings.**

### 🔑 Key Functions  

#### 1️⃣ Initialize Contract (Required)

```rust
pub fn initialize(env: Env, admin: Address)
```

- **Auth Required:** None (one-time initialization).  
- **Functionality:** Sets up the contract with an admin address for secure operations.
- **Security:** Prevents re-initialization attacks.

#### 2️⃣ Minting an NFT  

```rust
pub fn mint_nft(env: Env, to: Address, name: String, description: String, attributes: Vec<String>) -> u32
```

- **Auth Required:** Admin (when admin is set), otherwise permissionless for backwards compatibility.  
- **Functionality:** Creates a new NFT, assigns it a unique ID, and stores metadata.  
- **Returns:** `token_id` (Unique identifier of the NFT).
- **Security Features:**
  - Integer overflow protection
  - Input validation (name 1-100 chars, description ≤500 chars, ≤20 attributes)
  - Supply limit enforcement
  - Event emission

#### 3️⃣ Updating NFT Metadata  

```rust
pub fn update_metadata(env: Env, admin: Address, token_id: u32, name: String, description: String, attributes: Vec<String>)
```

- **Auth Required:** Admin with proper authentication.  
- **Functionality:** Allows the admin to update the name, description, and attributes of an NFT.  
- **Security Features:**
  - Admin authentication required
  - Input validation
  - Event emission

#### 4️⃣ Transferring an NFT  

```rust
pub fn transfer_nft(env: Env, from: Address, to: Address, token_id: u32)
```

- **Auth Required:** Current owner (`from`).  
- **Functionality:** Transfers ownership of the NFT to another address.  
- **Security Features:**
  - Self-transfer prevention
  - Ownership verification
  - Event emission

#### 5️⃣ Burning an NFT  

```rust
pub fn burn_nft(env: Env, owner: Address, token_id: u32)
```

- **Auth Required:** Owner.  
- **Functionality:** Permanently deletes an NFT from storage.  
- **Security Features:**
  - Ownership verification
  - Event emission

#### 6️⃣ Querying NFT Details  

```rust
pub fn get_metadata(env: Env, token_id: u32) -> NFTMetadata
```

- **Auth Required:** None.  
- **Functionality:** Retrieves metadata details of an NFT.  
- **Returns:** `NFTMetadata` containing name, description, and attributes.

#### 7️⃣ Supply Management

```rust
pub fn set_max_supply(env: Env, admin: Address, max_supply: u32)
pub fn get_max_supply(env: Env) -> u32
pub fn get_current_supply(env: Env) -> u32
```

- **Auth Required:** Admin (for setting).  
- **Functionality:** Configure and query supply limits.

### 🔍 Security Considerations  

- **Access Control:**  
  - Only the admin (set in `initialize`) can update metadata and configure supply limits.
  - Owners must authorize transfers and burns.  
  - Minting requires admin authorization when admin is configured.

- **Input Validation:**  
  - Name: 1-100 characters required
  - Description: ≤500 characters
  - Attributes: ≤20 attributes, each ≤100 characters

- **Overflow Protection:**  
  - Token counter overflow prevention with controlled error messages
  - Maximum supply enforcement

- **Event Transparency:**
  - All operations emit events for off-chain monitoring
  - Events include: MINT, TRANSFER, BURN, METADATA_UPDATE

- **Storage Optimization:**  
  - NFT data is stored persistently using `env.storage().persistent()`.  
  - The counter for new NFTs is only updated when minting.  

- **Testing Notes:**  
  - Ensure correct admin setup during initialization.  
  - All security vulnerabilities are covered by automated tests.
  - Edge cases and boundary conditions are thoroughly tested.
