## 📝 Contract Interface

### Admin Operations
```rust
fn initialize(env: Env, admin: Address) -> Result<(), PaymentError>
fn upgrade(env: Env, new_wasm_hash: BytesN<32>) -> Result<(), PaymentError>
fn transfer_admin(env: Env, new_admin: Address) -> Result<(), PaymentError>
fn get_admin(env: Env) -> Result<Address, PaymentError>
```

### Transaction Operations
```rust
fn process_deposit(
    env: Env,
    token_id: Address,
    signer: Address,
    to: Address,
    amount_to_deposit: i128
) -> Result<(), TransactionError>
```

### Refund Operations
```rust
fn process_refund(
    env: Env,
    token_id: Address,
    from: Address,
